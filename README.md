This beginner-friendly project walks you through creating a bank account application using the Java programming language. The application greets the user and asks them which function they would like to perform. Options are:
A. Check balance
B. Make deposit
C. Make withdrawal 
D. View previous transaction
E. Calculate interest
F. Exit the application

This is a great introductory to object-oriented programming (OOP) because we create an object called 'account' that we interact with.
